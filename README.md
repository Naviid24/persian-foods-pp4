# Persian Foods

Persian Foods is a full-stack web application designed to provide users with a platform to explore, share, and interact with a wide variety of recipes. The website’s goal is to offer a simple, intuitive, visually appealing, and user-friendly space where users can discover recipes shared by food enthusiasts from all over the world, contribute their own recipes, and engage with the community.
